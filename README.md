# 🌟 Hi, I'm Mesude Gürün! 🌟

## 📍 Industrial Engineering Student @ Middle East Technical University (METU)
Hey there! I’m Mesude, a passionate industrial engineering student with a strong focus on production management, project planning, process optimization, and data analytics. I enjoy bringing technology into processes and making them work smarter and more efficiently. 🚀

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- **🧵 [Kizilay Shelter Systems: AI-Powered Production Predictor & Optimizer](https://github.com/mesudegrn/kizilay-ai-predictor)** Developed an interactive decision support system using **Streamlit** and **Machine Learning**. This application predicts embroidery production durations and daily capacities while providing dynamic optimization suggestions. It compares real-time manufacturing inputs with mathematically optimal parameters to identify efficiency gaps.  
  

- **📈 [Kizilay Shelter Systems: Embroidery Production Optimization with R](https://github.com/mesudegrn/kizilay-embroidery-opt)** Applied **Polynomial Regression** and **ANOVA** to identify the mathematical "sweet spot" for industrial embroidery machines. This project focuses on minimizing unit production time and error rates (thread breaks, needle failures) through statistical modeling. Includes predictive insights for humanitarian aid manufacturing cycles.

- **🔧 [IE-Tech-Manufacturing-Company Optimization Model](https://github.com/mesudegrn/IE-tech-manufacturing-company)** A linear programming model designed for IE-Tech Manufacturing Company to optimize the production and sales of robotic kits and components across plants in İstanbul, Ankara, and İzmir. Maximizes profitability while managing labor, assembly, and material constraints.

- **📊 [OliveGold Cooperative: Profit-Maximizing Olive Oil Production and Distribution Model](https://github.com/mesudegrn/Olivegold-Company-Transportation-Optimization-Model/tree/main)** Linear programming optimization model for Türkiye's premium olive oil production. Navigates supply constraints, blending ratios, and export opportunities to maximize total cooperative profit.

- **📈 [Cybersecurity Case Study: Comparative Analysis of Detection and Resolution Metrics](https://github.com/mesudegrn/statistical-comparison-between-cyber-defense-companies)** In-depth statistical analysis conducted as part of the **IE266 course at METU**. Leverages data from 3 organizatons to compare detection and resolution times for ransomware, DDoS, and phishing attacks.
